// 5.2.3.7. Preferred Symmetric Algorithms
//
//    (array of one-octet values)
//
//    Symmetric algorithm numbers that indicate which algorithms the key
//    holder prefers to use. The subpacket body is an ordered list of
//    octets with the most preferred listed first. It is assumed that only
//    algorithms listed are supported by the recipientâ€™s software.
//    Algorithm numbers are in Section 9. This is only found on a self-
//    signature.
